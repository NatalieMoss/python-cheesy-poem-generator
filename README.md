# Cheesy Poem Generator
## Description
This program was written to celebrate my friend getting two new refrigerators. His old fridge had an unfortunate issue  with the cheese drawer getting flooded with water. Now, he not only has dry cheese, but also cheesy poems from this generator that he liked so much that he had them made into a custom refrigerator poetry magnet set.
